# Indexing in Python
# Strings are indexed in Python, starting from 0 for the first character.
# Negative indexing is also supported, where -1 refers to the last character.
# Example string
String="I Am Vinay"
char=String[0] # Accessing the first character using positive indexing
print("First character (positive indexing):", char) #printing the first characte
print(String[5]) # Accessing the sixth character using positive indexing
