# while loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a given condition is true.
# while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance.
# Example: print numbers from 1 to 5
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    if (i == 3):
     break  # exit the loop when i is 3
    i += 1  # increment the value of i by 1
